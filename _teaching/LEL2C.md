English in Time and Space covers the basic principles of historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and dialectology, and how these relate to the history of English. 


The course starts with contemporary British dialects and considers the history that has led to current patterns. The next phase examines how those dialects level and reform into new dialects in territories outside of Britain, especially the United States, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the effects of contact with other languages in postcolonial settings. We then move gradually backwards, covering major periods from Early Modern English to pre- Old English.
