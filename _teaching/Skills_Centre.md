The PPLS (Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences) Writing Centre is run by the School of PPLS for undergraduate and postgraduate students. It provides appointments, resources, and activities designed to them improve their research and writing. A major component of this is the Skills Centre tutors, whom students are able to book for one hour one-on-one sessions, for guidance and assistance with common writing difficulties such as structuring, clarity, guiding the reader through the argument and argument development. 


As a Skills Centre tutor I aim to help students with their assignments and gain an understanding of:

 - The difference between repeating different theoretical opinions and analysing them.
 - Creating an argument that is backed up by evidence from the literature and/or their empirical observations.
 - Structuring their paragraphs to contain one argument per block, with a clear opening and closing sentence to guide the reader.
 - Use of precise, concise language to meet word limit targets and avoid tangential arguments.
