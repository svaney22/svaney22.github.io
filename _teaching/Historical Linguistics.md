Historical Linguistics is an Honours and Masters level course that covers all the principles and theories of historical linguistics, examines change over time and patterns across various linguistic varieties, and how we can deduce larger systems of change and language spread over time. 


The course covers language birth, spread and development, language contact and borrowing, processes of change and development and language death and decline. Creoles and pidgins are discussed, as well as new colonial varieties, historical sociolinguistics and proto- or ancient linguistic varieties.
